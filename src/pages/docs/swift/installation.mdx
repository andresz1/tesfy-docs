# Installation

## CocoaPods

Tesfy is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Tesfy'
```

## Initialization
Once imported, instantiate the engine with a `datafile` and optionally a `storage` layer to enable sticky bucketing, a `userId` and a set of `attributes`.

```swift
import Tesfy

let tesfy = Tesfy(datafile: datafile, storage: storage, userId: userId, attributes: attributes)
```
